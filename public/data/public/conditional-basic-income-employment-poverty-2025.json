This reflects: (1) Multiple independent pilots show neutral-to-positive employment with poverty reduction, (2) No catastrophic employment collapse in any major pilot, (3) Meta-analysis shows <5% employment reduction (minimal but not zero), (4) BUT: all evidence is short-term (1-3 years), pilot-scale (not national), and general equilibrium effects untested. Conservative rounding applied - could justify 0.65 mathematically but rounded to 0.60 to emphasize genuine uncertainty. The 40% residual uncertainty reflects: (1) Long-term effects unknown (5-20 years), (2) General equilibrium effects when EVERYONE gets cash unknown, (3) Financing mechanisms untested, (4) Cross-country generalizability questionable (Kenya ≠ US labor markets). This is RUSHED SCIENCE where evidence is emerging rapidly but foundational questions remain unanswered. NOT canonical knowledge (0.90+), but promising pilot results (0.60) warrant continued research and cautious policy experimentation.",
