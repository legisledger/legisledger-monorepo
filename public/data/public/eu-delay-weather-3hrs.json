      "transparencyCommitment": "All Bayesian reasoning, confidence calculations, and uncertainty sources are disclosed. The relatively lower confidence (70% vs 85% in mechanical case) reflects genuine uncertainty in weather exception cases. We do not artificially inflate confidence to appear more authoritative."
