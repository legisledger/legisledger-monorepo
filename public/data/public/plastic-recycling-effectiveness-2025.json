    "description": "Is plastic recycling an effective, scalable, and sustainable method for reducing plastic waste and environmental impact?",
    "domain": "scientific/policy",
    "motivatingExample": {
      "trigger": "A consumer placing plastic items with the Mobius Loop symbol into a blue recycling bin, believing the material will be processed into a new, equivalent product.",
      "userConfusion": "Conflation of high collection rates (what goes in the bin) with low processing/recycling rates (what becomes a new product).",
      "clarification": "The actual recycling rate is significantly lower than collection, driven by economics, technical barriers, and polymer degradation (downcycling)."

    "parameters": {
      "population": "Global plastic waste stream",
      "intervention": "Mechanical (sorting/melting) and Chemical (pyrolysis/gasification) recycling processes",
