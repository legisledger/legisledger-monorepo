Five independent lines of evidence all converge: isotopic proof of source, temperature system agreement, direct mechanism observation, diagnostic fingerprints, paleoclimate context. Matches IPCC AR6 'unequivocal' assessment. Remaining 5% uncertainty reflects epistemic humility about exact sensitivity and regional impacts, not doubt about core attribution claim.",

        "IPCC represents scientific consensus but has been criticized for both over-conservatism (downplaying risks) and alarmism (exaggerating certainty) - we treat IPCC as authoritative summary while maintaining epistemic humility",
        "Political polarization on climate may unconsciously influence evidence selection - we attempt to counteract by explicitly including skeptic-operated datasets (UAH, Berkeley Earth)",
        "Fossil fuel industry funding of contrary research creates perception of controversy beyond scientific uncertainty - we focus on evidence quality not funding source",

        "Abstract created by non-climate-scientists relying on secondary sources - domain expert review essential",

        "Paleoclimate evidence is contextual not directly attributional - included for completeness but marked as neutral Bayes Factor",
        "Confidence intervals [0.92, 0.97] are judgment-based not mathematically derived from data - represent reasonable range around point estimate",

      "updateMechanism": "Annual review when major observational datasets updated or new attribution studies published. Major update warranted if: (1) New temperature system contradicts consensus, (2) Alternative forcing mechanism proposed with supporting evidence, (3) Spectroscopic measurements found to be artifacts, (4) Isotopic analysis methodology challenged. Unlikely to require major revision based on current evidence strength.",
      "transparencyCommitment": "All Bayesian calculations use empirically sourced probabilities from published methodology (detection rates, false positive rates). All data sources provide raw data URLs. Conservative defaults applied throughout (rounded to 0.95 not 0.97, used higher false positive estimates where uncertain). Contradictory evidence explicitly addressed (skeptic datasets included). No hidden assumptions. This is not 'trust the experts' - this is 'verify the data yourself.'"
