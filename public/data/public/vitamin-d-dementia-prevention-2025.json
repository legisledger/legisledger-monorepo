  "disclaimer": {
    "nature": "educational",
    "notCertainty": "50% confidence means we estimate equal probability this claim is correct vs. incorrect based on current evidence. This is maximum uncertainty - we genuinely don't know if vitamin D supplementation prevents dementia. Science is provisional and will be updated as new evidence emerges.",

      "notMedicalAdvice": true,
      "consultProfessional": true,
      "specificWarning": "If you have vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL), supplementation to correct deficiency is medically recommended for bone health. The question here is whether supplementation beyond deficiency correction prevents dementia - this remains unproven."

      "potentialBiases": [
        "Selection of studies: Focused on recent meta-analyses and landmark studies, may miss some relevant research",
        "Bayesian probabilities: Conservative rounding toward uncertainty, but probability assignments involve judgment",
        "No original data analysis: Relies on published summaries, not individual participant data",
        "Publication bias: Positive observational studies more likely published than null results",
        "Funding: Some vitamin D research industry-funded (supplement manufacturers), though major trials (VITAL, Finnish) publicly funded"

      "howToVerify": [
        "Search PubMed for 'vitamin D supplementation dementia RCT' - check for newer trials beyond Finnish trial",
        "Read Finnish Vitamin D Trial full paper (DOI: 10.1093/gerona/glaf077) - verify we correctly reported findings",
        "Consult Alzheimer's Association website for current prevention guidelines",
        "Check Cochrane Library for systematic reviews on vitamin D and dementia",
        "Discuss with neurologist or geriatrician - ask about current clinical guidance"

      "strengthsOfThisAnalysis": [
        "Uses most recent evidence (2024-2025 meta-analyses and Finnish RCT)",
        "Explicitly distinguishes observational associations from causal evidence",
        "Transparent Bayesian reasoning with sourced probabilities",
        "Conservative approach - biases toward uncertainty rather than false confidence",
        "Clear distinction between deficiency association and supplementation benefit",

        "Single analyst (not independent peer review yet)"
      ],
      "specialConsiderations": "Dementia has long latency period (decades). Even if vitamin D has protective effect, benefits may not appear for 10-20+ years of supplementation. Current trials may be too short. However, this is speculation - needs testing.",
      "updateMechanism": "Quarterly review. Major update trigger: Publication of large RCT with adequate power (300+ dementia events). Will monitor ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing vitamin D dementia prevention trials.",
      "transparencyCommitment": "All Bayesian calculations documented and reproducible using public calculator (https://www.gigacalculator.com/calculators/bayes-theorem-calculator.php). All probability sources cited. No hidden assumptions or proprietary models."
