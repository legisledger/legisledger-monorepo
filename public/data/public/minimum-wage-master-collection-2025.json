  "description": "Master index for minimum wage knowledge claims. Demonstrates structured disagreement where expert opinions differ based on evidence quality, study design, and interpretation - exactly what Legis Ledger is designed to handle.",
  
  "dateCreated": "2025-11-07",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  
  "abstract": {
    "motivatingContext": "Minimum wage policy is one of the most contested economic issues, with respected economists reaching opposite conclusions from similar evidence. This collection demonstrates how Legis Ledger preserves structured disagreement rather than forcing false consensus.",
    
    "whyThisMatters": "Users need to understand WHY experts disagree, not just that they do. By showing transparent Bayesian reasoning, we enable informed judgment rather than appeal to authority.",
    
    "keyInsight": "Different claims have different evidence quality. Employment effects (highly contested, 0.50 confidence) vs. poverty reduction (better evidence, 0.60 confidence). This is NOT 'both sides-ism' - it's precise epistemic mapping."

  "relatedClaims": [
    {
      "id": "minimum-wage-employment-effects-2025",
      "claim": "Minimum wage increases reduce employment for low-wage workers",
      "confidence": 0.50,
      "evidenceGrade": "A (meta-analyses)",
      "funnelPosition": "middle-funnel-testing",
      "status": "Highly contested - experts genuinely disagree",
      "reasoning": "Evidence is mixed. Meta-analyses show: (1) Small negative effects (Martínez & Martínez 2020: 588 studies), (2) Near-zero effects (Doucouliagos & Stanley 2009: 64 studies), (3) Context-dependent effects (monopsony markets show different patterns). Publication bias exists but doesn't fully explain disagreement.",
      "keyUncertainties": [
        "Effect size depends on labor market structure (competitive vs. monopsonistic)",
        "Varies by population (teens vs. adults, skilled vs. unskilled)",
        "Magnitude matters (small increases vs. large increases to $15/hr)",
        "Regional differences (high-cost vs. low-cost areas)",
        "Time horizon (short-term vs. long-term effects differ)"

        "dube2019": "Overall body of evidence suggests muted employment effects, near-zero median elasticity",
        "explanation": "Different weighting of studies, different identification strategies, different populations studied. BOTH are legitimate expert interpretations of contested evidence."

      "funnelPosition": "middle-funnel-testing",
      "status": "Moderate evidence, some ambiguity",
      "reasoning": "Evidence leans toward poverty reduction but with important caveats. Dube (2019) found 10% minimum wage increase → 2-4% poverty reduction. Simulation studies (Cooper & Kroeger 2017) predict $12 minimum wage → 16% poverty drop. BUT: Burkhauser et al. (2022) found nearly all estimates centered near zero. Targeting is imperfect - less than 10% of affected workers live in poor families.",
